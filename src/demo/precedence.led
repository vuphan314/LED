Currently, all infix operands are parenthesized in the generated \TeX{} code:
/$
zero := 0 * (1 + 2)
$/

Otherwise, this error would appear in the \TeX{} code:
$$ zero := 0 \times 1 + 2 $$

(Automatic removal of unnecessary parentheses is nontrivial.)

test:
\begin{verbatim}
cmd:>pp(zero)
"0"
\end{verbatim}
